# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./images/image-product-desktop.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

With a mobile first plan, my gaol for the users was to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
